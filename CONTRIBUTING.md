# Intro
Welcome! First of all, I would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We want to make this a simple process for you, so if you would like to contribute, please continue reading.

# Standards
We want to keep this project a safe environment for anyone to contribute. We would like everyone to follow these guidelines to stay proffesional. 

- Being respectful towards opposing viewpoints, have a discussion, not a fight.
- Be constructive, give feedback that we can build on.

That's it! If you follow these guidelines, you should have a very good time here.

# Making your First Contribution
We love feedback, if you have any ideas, we would love to hear them! Whether it's:
- Providing feedback on the quality, functionality or performance
- Submitting improvements
- Fixing a bug
- Reporting an issue

All of these can be done by either:
- Making an [issue](https://github.com/DuckOS-GitHub/DuckOS/issues/new/choose)
- Creating a [pull request](https://github.com/DuckOS-GitHub/DuckOS/Atlas/pulls)

## Adding to the code
When contributing, please be mindful of what you are doing.
Think of these while contributing:
- Will this break anything? Can it be fixed while keeping the improvement?
- What does this affect? Is it placebo?
- Has it been thoroughly tested/discussed?

# Testing and Review
Doing all of these _aren't_ required but appreciated. Please mention in the pull request what you have completed.
Testing and reviewing should be very easy here's what to test:
- Look over your changes, make sure there's nothing you missed.
- First, test it on a virtual machine, my recommedation is VMWare Workstation. A good alternative is Oracle VirtualBox.
- Test what your contribution affects, this is dependant on what you change.
- Test basic programs and functionalities.
- Test on an actual machine now, repeat the steps.

I [(fikinoob)](https://github.com/fikinoob), will be the main tester and reviewer, if you would like to become a reviewer/tester, ask on our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/duckos)
