# DuckOS

## What is DuckOS?

A open-sourced Windows operating system, which is a modification of the original windows 10, designed to improve performance and reduce latency.

### Notes & Disclaimers
⚠️ ***This iso IS STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT / ALPHA! Meaning bugs will occur, but duckOS is stable enough!***
📝 This ISO is a highly modified fork of [Atlas-OS](https://atlasos.net)! Be aware of this and don't say the ISO is stolen!

### **What do we offer?**

DuckOS is **pre-tweaked**. While maintaining compatibility, but also good for performance. Here's a good list of what we did to make the image very fast:

- Disabled Power Saving
- Automatically enabled MSI Mode
- Custom Power Plan
- Minimized Drivers
- Minimized Services
- Disabled every single bit of telemetry, meaning your private and don't have to worry about anyone spying on you -- including group policies, registry edits, and more!
- Disabled Unneeded Devices
- Boot Configuration Optimization
- Optimized Process Scheduling
- ~ 705 Components removed.
- Removed almost every unneeded windows boot entry, including clearing scheduled tasks...

## DuckOS vs Windows 10 Original (*stock*)

DuckOS is really good at many things, here's a list that why you **should use** DuckOS and **not** Windows 10 Original (*stock*):
- Processes, while it doesn't matter as much, it's good too see that not much is running on your system.. which is a good sign of good component removing.
- Ram Usage, matters, because Windows 10 Original wastes your RAM doing nothing, we made sure that doesn't happen on DuckOS by removing lot's of components.
- CPU at 0% usage idle, but this really depends on the processor.
- Less services
- Less unneeded drivers
- More FPS, less lags in general
- Faster wifi due to tweaks
- and more!

### **Debloated**

DuckOS is heavily debloated, pre-installed applications and other components are removed. Although this can break some compatibility, it significantly reduces ISO and install size. Programs such as Windows Defender, and such are stripped completely. This modification is focused on pure gaming, but most work and business.

### Security

Since there are a lot of features disabled for performance, we also care about security.

**What do we do?**

We disable features that can leak personal information or be exploited and be used in a large attack.
Those features are: 

- [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
- [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
- [DMA Remapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)
- [(Patched) ATMFD Exploit](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1020)
- [(Patched) Print Nightmare](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability)
- [Remote Desktop](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Windows+Remote+Desktop)
- [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS)

*NOTE: Clicking on the blue text will re-direct you to a link with an explanation for each and every feature.*

### Cons [What's not so good about duckOS?]

But we aren't perfect, and here's some things you shoud considered before installing DuckOS on your computer:
- More likely to crash (not always the case)
- Lots of features disabled/broken/limited due to lots of components removed
- More likely to give you weird, but fixable errors.
- You have to manually install drivers..
